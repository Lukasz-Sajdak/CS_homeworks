# Triathlon-Inspired Race Inheritance  

This project demonstrates class inheritance in C# using a race-based hierarchy.  

## Class Hierarchy  
- **Race** (Base class)  
  - **WaterRace**  
    - **Swimming**  
      - OpenWaterSwimming  
      - PoolSwimming  
  - **LandRace**  
    - Cycling  
    - Running  

## Features  
- Demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.  
- Uses inheritance to model different types of races.  
- Implements encapsulation with appropriate access modifiers.
